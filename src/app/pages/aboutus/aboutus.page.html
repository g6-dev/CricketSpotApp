  <h6><strong>Goals</strong></h6>
  <p style="color:rgba(155, 155, 155, 0.945)">Build and deploy apps that work across multiple platforms, such as native iOS, Android, desktop, and the web as a 
    Progressive Web App - all with one code base. Write once, run anywhere.
    Ionic Framework is built on top of reliable, standardized web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, using modern
     Web APIs such as Custom Elements and Shadow DOM. Because of this, Ionic components have a stable API, and aren't at 
     the whim of a single platform vendor.</p>
